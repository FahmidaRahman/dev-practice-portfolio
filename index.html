            <p>"Assalamu-Alaikum" everyone. I'm Fahmida Rahman Nira. I belong to CSE background but I always love to
                design anything since my childhood. That's why I looked for design something in my job so I became a web
                developer. And Then I fulfilled my childhood dream as a fashion designer as well. Ohh! by the way, I
                also wrote a book.</p>
